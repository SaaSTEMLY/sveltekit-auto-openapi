# Introduction

Welcome to SvelteKit Auto OpenAPI! This library provides type-safe OpenAPI generation and runtime validation for SvelteKit applications.

## Overview

SvelteKit Auto OpenAPI helps you:

- **Generate OpenAPI schemas automatically** from your TypeScript types
- **Validate requests and responses** at runtime using JSON Schema
- **Document your APIs** with beautiful interactive documentation
- **Maintain type safety** throughout your entire application
